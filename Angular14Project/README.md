## Running Unit Tests With Code Coverage

```bash
npm run test -- --code-coverage
```

Then open the `index.html` file located at `coverage/angular14-project` in your browser.

Use the report to become aware of where your source code is missing unit tests.


## Running Stryker

Then, use it to run stryker's init command.
```bash

## How We Installed Stryker (Just FYI ðŸ˜‰)

First, install stryker as a dev dependency:
```bash

```

Then we answered the questions promts with these answers:
